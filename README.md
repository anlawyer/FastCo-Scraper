# FastCo Article Scraper

An application that scrapes articles from fastcompany.com and allows users to save and comment on them. I used Cheerio and Axios to scrape the Fast Company website, and MongoDB/Mongoose to store all scraped articles, saved articles, and comments. I used Bulma and Handlebars.js for front-end. A full stack application using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Bulma, Handlebars.js, JavaScript, Cheerio and Axios.
